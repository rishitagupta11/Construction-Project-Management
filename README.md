# 📊 Project Schedule Visualization using Excel

This repository contains a **Construction Schedule** project created using Microsoft Excel. The project demonstrates the scheduling of various construction activities over a specified timeline using a Gantt chart.

## 🚀 Overview
The project visualizes tasks, start and end dates, and duration using a custom Gantt chart built in Excel. The schedule outlines a step-by-step construction process for **Project-ABC** and highlights task dependencies, timelines, and resource planning.

## 📝 Key Features
1. **Gantt Chart Visualization**
   - Visualizes project activities over a daily timeline.
   - Highlights tasks with a clear and intuitive chart.
2. **Task Breakdown**
   - Activities include foundation laying, reinforcement, slab work, and more.
   - Days, start dates, and finish dates are documented.
3. **Custom Formulas**
   - Uses conditional formatting and logical Excel formulas (e.g., `IF` statements) to auto-fill cells for task duration.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: To create the Gantt chart and schedule.
- **Formulas**: Conditional logic for date-based highlighting.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **Excel File**: Contains the Gantt chart and construction schedule.
- **README.md**: Project overview and documentation.
